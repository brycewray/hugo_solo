Your opening text goes here

## In-article heading --- it's an H2 because your title is the H1

And after another paragraph or two or three, you may want to add a subheading, which would be an H3, so it would be like the following.

### Subheading (H3)

Text here.

And here's an example of how to use the `img` shortcode in `/layouts/shortcodes` (note that the images must be in the same folder with the content, because of how Hugo bundles do image processing, so that's why the `src` references don't include a folder upfront):

{{< img src="Early-Web-font-grfx-1-2018-10-16_1218x1296.jpg" alt="Image from Apple Web site in 1999 showing graphic elements as text" >}}

Closing text. That ends Post 2!
