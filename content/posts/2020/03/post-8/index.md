 Your opening text goes here.

## In-article heading --- it's an H2 because your title is the H1

And after another paragraph or two or three, you may want to add a subheading, which would be an H3, so it would be like the following.

### Subheading (H3)

Text here.

And here are some examples of how to use the `img` shortcode in `/layouts/shortcodes` (note that the images must be in the same folder with the content, because of how Hugo bundles do image processing, so that's why the `src` references don't include a folder upfront):

{{< img src="Mom-and-Dad-admire-Kennedy-first-night__1008x756.jpg" alt="Brad and Sarah Beck (the latter is our daughter) admire their new child, Kennedy, less than an hour after her arrival" >}}

<p class="lazypicturecaption">Our daughter and son-in-law, Sarah and Brad, admire their new baby, less than an hour after she arrived.</p>

{{< img src="BW-holding-Kennedy-first-night__crop_1008x712.jpg" alt="Bryce Wray holds his new granddaughter, Kennedy Beck, on the night of her birth" >}}

<p class="lazypicturecaption">Your faithful correspondent holds his first grandchild for the first time, <span class="nobrk">on the first night of her life.</span> <span class="nobrk">Enough &ldquo;firsts&rdquo; for you there?</p>

{{< img src="Kennedy-goes-home__crop_1008x1021.jpg" alt="Kennedy Beck, a newborn baby, rests in a car seat as she goes home for the first time" >}}

<p class="lazypicturecaption">Despite her slightly early arrival, Kennedy checked out just fine over the next couple of days, and Mom and Dad got to take her home when she was a bit over <span class="nobrk">forty-three hours old</span>.</p>

Closing text. That ends Post 8!
